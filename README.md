# SimpleFS FUSE Driver
This is a FUSE driver for [Ocawesome's SimpleFS filesystem](https://github.com/Ocawesome101/cynosure-2-docs/blob/primary/fs/simplefs.2) used in [Cynosure 2](https://github.com/oc-ulos/oc-cynosure-2/). It is a great beginner filesystem, but there are no support for it outside of Cynosure 2, which is confined to the OpenComputers mod.

This will mostly be used for my projects that use SimpleFS so that I don't have to open up an emulator to create or put files into an image, but you are welcome to contribute.
